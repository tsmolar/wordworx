0.6.99 - 2016-8-5 (0.7.0 prerelease)
   * Begin supporting SDL1 and SDL2
   * Added new sa_setalpha because this function is slightly different 
     between SDL1 and SDL2
   * Added new s2a_flip to mimic SDL_Flip() in SDL1
   * Add Textures for intermediate step

0.6.12 - 2016-7-28
   * Add stretch_blit()

0.6.11 - 2009-7-6
   * created sa_readpcx and sa_readpcx to load pcx images
   * Fix so that it can load images created by gimp and imagemagick

0.6.10 - 2009-6-30
   * Created save_pcx_pf save_pcx now calls this

0.6.9 - 2009-4-17
   * Changed getpixel from SDL_BYTEORDER == SDL_BIG_ENDIAN to
     SDL_BYTEORDER != SDL_BIG_ENDIAN.   This seems to fix the 
     problem I was having with colors in the scaling functions,
     but it's disturbing that the problem exists in the first place
     since that code was copied straight from the SDL website.

0.6.8 - 2009-3-10
   * save_pcx, implemented.   SDL_image not required!

0.6.7 - 2009-3-3
   * Added save_bitmap, save_bmp, save_pcx (doesn't do anything)
   TODO
     - What does load_bitmap actually do?
     - Create a pcx writing util

0.6.6 - 2009-1-20
   * Added create_system_bitmap,  basically calls create_bitmap for now
   * Added triangle, but doesn't currently fill
   * Added mouse_b for middle & right button too

0.6.5 - 2008-7-25
   * Volume Control in play_sample now works (supposedly)

0.6.3 - 2008
   * For GFX_TEXT, close and reinit gfx mode
   * fix rest() so that passing a 0 sends a NULL to SDL_waitevent()
   * Made simulate_keypress work.

0.6.2 - 2007-12-14
   * install_int attempts to remove already installed timers before
     reinstalling

0.6.1 - 2007-12-04
   * sa_sdl_info - prints info about SDL hardware capabilities
   * sa_surface_info - prints info about given surface

0.6.0 - 2007-10-05, 2007-11-27
   * Adding timer routines
   * rest()
   * install, remove_timer
   * set_keyboard_rate()
   * remove_keyboard()

   * Created -config script

0.5.14 - 2007-05-25
   * Fixes for Zaurus
   * Added Driver Check

0.5.13 - 2007-05-21
   * allegro_init was not returning a status, causing problems suddenly
     for Zaurus

0.5.12 - 2007-05-08
   * SDL_Init was being called twice, once in allegro_init and once in
     gfx_set_mode.  Removed the one in gfx_set_mode.   This seems
     to speed up initialization and exitting!

0.5.11 - 2007-05-04
   * Added makeacol* and geta for alpha blending
   * Integrated into config.h for SDL_Mixer
   * Added more Keysyms
