   * Volume Control in play_sample now works (supposedly)

0.6.3 - 2008
   * For GFX_TEXT, close and reinit gfx mode
   * fix rest() so that passing a 0 sends a NULL to SDL_waitevent()
   * Made simulate_keypress work.

0.6.2 - 2007-12-14
   * install_int attempts to remove already installed timers before
     reinstalling

0.6.1 - 2007-12-04
   * sa_sdl_info - prints info about SDL hardware capabilities
   * sa_surface_info - prints info about given surface

0.6.0 - 2007-10-05, 2007-11-27
   * Adding timer routines
   * rest()

0.5.14 - 2007-05-25
   * Fixes for Zaurus
   * Added Driver Check

0.5.13 - 2007-05-21
   * allegro_init was not returning a status, causing problems suddenly
     for Zaurus

0.5.12 - 2007-05-08
   * SDL_Init was being called twice, once in allegro_init and once in
     gfx_set_mode.  Removed the one in gfx_set_mode.   This seems
     to speed up initialization and exitting!

   * Added makeacol* and geta for alpha blending
   * Integrated into config.h for SDL_Mixer
   * Added more Keysyms
