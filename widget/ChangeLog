2.1.9
  * wdg_adjust - for moving widgets on res change
  * wdg_refresh - for redrawing widgets when needed
  
2.1.8
  * button.c - added wdg_add_bmp_button(),  this handles bitmaps
      better than the old function, and is compatible with floating 
      windows
  * dialog.c - Added SU_BMPBUTTON for bitmap buttons
  * Create bitmap buttons,  still need to allow them to be animated
  * Fixed save_under and restore_under so that they can use floating windows

2.1.7
  * dialog.c - +/- widget for selecting  SU_PLUSMINUS
  * dialog.c - better bitmap handling,
  * Bitmap file can be specified
  * bitmap regions can be assigned to labels
  * changing a select can now change bitmaps
  * labels are stored in the env structure, might need a separate
    array structure for this
  * A bitmap file DOES NOT need to be specified for each new dialog, if they 
    all use the same one.

2.1.6
  * Tried using a Cancel button in floating window, it leads to crashes
    I think it's because the event_loop in widget is still processing
    when cancel destroys the widgets being processed (causing the 
    linked list to get 'lost').  I think if I wan't to be able to
    do this, then I need to mark widgets for deletion (active flag=2
    or something), then afterwards delete them linearly.
  * reworked parts of the destroy window, since it wasn't stable on linux
  * fixed the destroy_tree procedure to remember that it is using a 
    doubly linked list!
  * other stability fixes for Linux.

2.1.5
  * Added flags to help prevent click-throughs on floating window
    (it's up to the program to determine whether to ignore these)
  * Added id and index fields,  these can help debug widget library
    as well as help dialog
  * dialog.c - you can assign a value to the widget id in the variable
    definition
  * dialog.c - dialog_buttoncb() changed so that P_CANCEL is no longer the
    default button,  it checks the widget ID field to see what the button
    should do,  not all buttons close the window now.
  * added wdg_destroy, should be able to destroy any widget, should we 
    used this as the destroy callback now?   Instead of button_destroy and
    others?
  * wdg_tree_destroy seems to properly close a window tree now, including
    keeping the widget linked list sane.
  * dialog.c - added two flags,  fdlg_active and fdlg_lastopen, so that 
    we can see what it's doing.

2.1.4
  * Many new functions that can set a parent,  the goal is to have
    the old functions call the new ones
  * Can draw to a bitmap,  doesn't seem like everything currently draws
    such as the background style_rectfile (seems to draw to the screen)

2.1.1
  * Started allowing windows to be drawn to bitmaps
  * Added Parent Pointer
  TODO:
    The goal is to produce free floating windows.  Windows of this type:
    1. all sub widgets should have a pointer to its parent widget, so that
       they can be moved, deactivated, & destroyed by finding a parent.
       They are on the same level as the base, so that they don't
       freeze the program.
    2. These widgets need an active flag, so they can be hidden or 
       unfocused.
    3. They should have an X/Y offset settings from their parent, so
       when the parent is moved, their new position can be quickly calculatd
    4. These windows should be stored in a bitmap, the size of the window
       stored in the widget structure (extra field maybe?)
    5. draggable window bars-- eventually.

2.1.0 - 2008-8-28
  * Integrated Changed from emufe

2.0.2 - 2007-01-17
  * Draggable bmp buttons repeatedly call handler when they are depressed.
    This might cause other problems, but what good is a draggable button
    without this?

2.0.1 - 11/27/2007
  * Fixed a bug in button creation that causes a crash on some platforms
    when the button is destroyed

1.9.5 - 2007-05-04
  * Fixed some things that could cause segfaults under certain conditions
  * Left and Right widget searching fixed,  they were not breaking out of
    a loop properly, causing only widgets on the bottom half of the screen
    to be found
  * Finished Text entry widget
  * Fixed text entry widget to accept char instead of int, this caused
    text to not display sometimes, creating a frustrating error to debug

1.9.0 - 2007-05-03
  * Added input.c for input widgets
  * Fixed the just_popped issue that was causing problems for the buttons
    (might not be completely fixed, but is better)
