1.9.5 - 2007-05-04
  * Fixed some things that could cause segfaults under certain conditions
  * Left and Right widget searching fixed,  they were not breaking out of
    a loop properly, causing only widgets on the bottom half of the screen
    to be found
  * Finished Text entry widget
  * Fixed text entry widget to accept char instead of int, this caused
    text to not display sometimes, creating a frustrating error to debug

1.9.0 - 2007-05-03
  * Added input.c for input widgets
  * Fixed the just_popped issue that was causing problems for the buttons
    (might not be completely fixed, but is better)
