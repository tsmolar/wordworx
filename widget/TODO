SDL specific code, but it's not complete.   The Macros GFXLIB_ALLEGRO
or GFXLIB_SDL should be used to determine which code to use

[ ] The procedure that handles keyboard focus should be a callback so that
    different types of keyboard widgets can be supported.

    and maybe even bitmaps
    
[ ] Once theme structure is in place,  consoldation of different constructors
    may be possible.
